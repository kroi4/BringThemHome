## Project Structure

- **app**: The main application code, including Activity and Fragment files.
- **gradle/wrapper**: Gradle files for project management.
- **.idea**: IntelliJ IDEA/Android Studio configuration files.

## Architecture

The project is built using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern. This ensures a clean separation of concerns and allows for easier testing and maintenance.

- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic of the app. It includes the data classes, database setup, and API interfaces.
- **View**: The UI layer that displays the data to the user. This includes Activities, Fragments, and Adapters.
- **ViewModel**: Acts as a bridge between the Model and the View. It holds the data and state of the UI and handles the logic to interact with the Model.

## User Interface

- **Main Screen**: The app's main screen is the kidnapped individuals' screen. Swiping left (or right, depending on the device language) will navigate to the returned individuals' screen. Another swipe will take you to the search screen, where all individuals are displayed and can be filtered based on various criteria.
- **Scrolling**: You can scroll up and down on each screen to display more cards.
- **Card Interaction**: Tapping on a card will display the details of the individual, allowing you to scroll down to read all the information. Long-pressing a card will copy the individual's details to the smartphone's clipboard.
